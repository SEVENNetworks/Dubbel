# Dubbel

Have you wished for the capability to use multiple accounts of a single app on your device? Dubbel makes this a reality! No need to log in and out every time you want to switch accounts. Clone apps and open them from Dubbel to store data in parallel. Your privacy is protected, and the data from each account is stored separately.

Dubbel is available on the Play Store.

## Open Source Bug Tracker

While Dubbel is not an Open Source application by itself, we want to provide a way to work with the community on issues within the application as well as provide transparency for what we are currently working on. To do this, we use GitHub as an Open Source bug tracker for community-driven issues.

### How to contribute
* Request a feature you would like to see in Dubbel
* Report bugs you notice while using the app
* Report if Dubbel is breaking an app that you use
* Ask questions you have about Dubbel

All of the above can be submitted through our [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/SEVENNetworks/Dubbel/issues)
